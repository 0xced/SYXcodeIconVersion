Xcode Icon Version
=======

Tired of this Xcode icon always showing multiple times in your App Switch with no help watshoever as to which version you are currently using? Well, no more !

How does it look?
====

Here is the app switcher with four different versions of Xcode running

And here is your Dock

How can I get it?
=======

It can either be done via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/) or by downloading the [GitHub project](github.com/dvkch/SYXcodeIconVersion) and building `SYXcodeIconVersion.xcodeproj` in Xcode, which will automagically install the plugin.

Use it as you like, don't blame me if your Macbook never restarts, and share with your friends,
